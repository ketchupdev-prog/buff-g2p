3.2 The Service is subject to availability, regulatory requirements, and our policies. We do not guarantee uninterrupted access.

4. E-MONEY AND WALLET

4.1 The funds in your Wallet constitute E-money issued in accordance with PSD-3. They are not a deposit with a bank and are not covered by deposit insurance. E-money is backed in full as required by the Bank of Namibia.

4.2 No interest is paid on Wallet balances.

4.3 You may hold only one primary Wallet per user account unless we expressly permit otherwise. Wallets are non-transferable except as permitted by the Service (e.g. sending money to another user).

5. REDEMPTION RIGHTS (PSD-3 §14)

5.1 You have the right to redeem your E-money balance for cash. Redemption into your Wallet (e.g. from a voucher) is free and instant where applicable. Cash-out via Till, Agent, Merchant, ATM, or bank transfer may attract fees as set out in our Fees and Charges Schedule. Current fees are always displayed in the App before you confirm a transaction.

5.2 We will not impose unreasonable barriers to redemption. Conditions and fees may change with notice; we will display any changes in the App before they take effect.

6. FEES AND CHARGES

6.1 Our current fees and charges are set out in the Fees and Charges Schedule (see Settings → Fees and charges in the App). Fees may vary by channel (e.g. Till, Agent, ATM). We will notify you of any increase before it applies.

6.2 By using a fee-bearing service, you agree to pay the applicable fee. Fees may be deducted from the transaction amount or from your Wallet balance as disclosed at the time of the transaction.

7. REGISTRATION, IDENTITY AND PROOF OF LIFE

7.1 You must provide accurate and complete information when registering and keep it up to date. We may require identity verification (KYC) and periodic re-verification, including "proof of life" checks as required for G2P programmes (e.g. every 90 days). Failure to complete verification may result in suspension or closure of your account and Wallet.

7.2 You are responsible for keeping your login credentials and PIN secure. You must notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorised access.

8. ACCEPTABLE USE

8.1 You must use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms and Namibian law. You must not use the Service for fraud, money laundering, terrorism financing, or any illegal activity. You must not attempt to circumvent security, abuse the Service, or harm other users or us.

8.2 We may suspend or terminate your access if we reasonably suspect breach of these Terms or of law, or to protect the integrity of the payment system.

9. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AND SIGNATURES (ETA)

9.2 You agree that your use of the App to authorise payments (including PIN or biometric confirmation) constitutes your electronic signature and indicates your intention to be bound, in line with the Electronic Transactions Act 4 of 2019. Such actions are legally binding to the extent permitted by Namibian law.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

10.1 To the fullest extent permitted by Namibian law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential loss or damage arising from your use or inability to use the Service, including loss of profits, data, or goodwill, except where such exclusion is not permitted by law.

10.2 Our total liability for any claim arising from or in connection with the Service shall not exceed the amount of the relevant transaction or the balance in your Wallet at the time of the event, whichever is the lesser, except where we have acted in bad faith or in wilful breach of these Terms.

10.3 We are not liable for delays or failures caused by third parties (e.g. networks, banks, agents), force majeure, or regulatory action.

11. COMPLAINTS

11.1 If you have a complaint, please contact us as set out in Settings → Contact us. We will acknowledge your complaint promptly and provide a substantive response within 15 (fifteen) working days of receipt. Complaints should be lodged in writing within 90 (ninety) days of the date of the incident.

11.2 If you are not satisfied with our response, you may request escalation to a suitably qualified person within our organisation. For payment system matters, you may also contact the Bank of Namibia (Banking Supervision; see our Contact us page for details).

12. AMENDMENTS

12.1 We may amend these Terms from time to time. We will give you notice of material changes via the App or by other reasonable means. Continued use of the Service after the effective date of the changes constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service and may close your account.

13. TERMINATION

13.1 You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access in accordance with these Terms or where required by law or regulation. On termination, you may redeem any remaining E-money balance subject to our Fees and Charges and redemption process.

14.1 These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Namibia. Any dispute arising from or in connection with these Terms or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Namibia, without prejudice to your right to refer payment system matters to the Bank of Namibia.

15. GENERAL

15.1 If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

15.2 These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and the Fees and Charges Schedule, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.
